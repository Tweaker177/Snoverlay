# Snoverlay
Overlay snowflakes on top of home/lock screen wallpaper, and/or on top of all apps system wide using a secure window. This branch will eventually have customizations added in to it and bug fixes (like the landscape sideways snow bug, also on iOS 12+ the wallpaper only option wasn't working). So far this fork has A12 support added, a fix for "Wallpaper Only" not working on iOS 12 and 13, and the landscape bug is half fixed now on 12 and 13. 

Still need to work more on the landscape bug, and then add customizations from SnoverlayCustomizer to prefs. Was thinking of adding an image picker as well, for custom images to animate on screen for a year-round enjoyable tweak.

Main credits for this tweaks creation and maintenance though go to leftyfl1p, Ryan Petrich and Chris Maddern.
