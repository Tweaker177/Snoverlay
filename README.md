# Snoverlay
Overlay snowflakes on top of home/lock screen wallpaper, and/or on top of all apps system wide using a secure window. This branch will eventually have customizations added in to it and bug fixes (like the landscape sideways snow bug, also on iOS 12+ the wallpaper only option isn't working). So far it just has A12 support added in my fork.

Main credits for this tweaks creation and maintenance go to leftyfl1p, Ryan Petrich and Chris Maddern.
